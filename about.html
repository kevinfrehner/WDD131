        <h2>Aspirations</h2>
        <div class="aspirations-content">
            <p>Through my education at Brigham Young University Idaho, I hope to receive a bachelor's in computer science, and receive valuable internships and knowledge along the way. Doing what makes me happy is most important to me and I work as hard as possible in order to achieve that. When deciding a major I knew I wanted to become a computer scientist, but what field I wanted to go into was unknown to me until as of late. After taking a data science class and getting exposed to languages like SQL, and python libraries such as Pandas, I knew that being a machine learning engineer was something that I would want to work towards in my professional career. </p>
